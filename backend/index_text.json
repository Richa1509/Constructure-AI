Please also note that the\nminimum wage requirements of Executive Order 14026 are not\ncurrently being enforced as to any contract or subcontract to\nwhich the states of Texas, Louisiana, or Mississippi, including\ntheir agencies, are a party.\nNote: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave\nfor Federal Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the\nDavis-Bacon Act for which the contract is awarded (and any\nsolicitation was issued) on or after January 1, 2017.  If this\ncontract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide\nemployees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours\nthey work, up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year.\nEmployees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their\nown illness, injury or other health-related needs, including\npreventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is\nlike family to the employee) who is ill, injured, or has other\nhealth-related needs, including preventive care; or for reasons\nresulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is\nlike family to the employee) who is a victim of, domestic\nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking.  Additional information\non contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO\nis available at\nhttps://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/government-contracts.\nUnlisted classifications needed for work not included within\nthe scope of the classifications listed may be added after\naward only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses\n(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (iii)).\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThe body of each wage determination lists the classifications\nand wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the\ntype(s) of construction and geographic area covered by the wage\ndetermination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical\norder under rate identifiers indicating whether the particular\nrate is a union rate (current union negotiated rate), a survey\nrate, a weighted union average rate, a state adopted rate, or a\nsupplemental classification rate.\nUnion Rate Identifiers\nA four-letter identifier beginning with characters other than\n\"\"SU\"\", \"\"UAVG\"\", ?SA?, or ?SC? denotes that a union rate was\nprevailing for that classification in the survey. Example:\nPLUM0198-005 07/01/2024. PLUM is an identifier of the union\nwhose collectively bargained rate prevailed in the survey for\nthis classification, which in this example would be Plumbers.\n0198 indicates the local union number or district council\nnumber where applicable, i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next\nnumber, 005 in the example, is an internal number used in\nprocessing the wage determination. The date, 07/01/2024 in the\nexample, is the effective date of the most current negotiated\nrate.\nUnion prevailing wage rates are updated to reflect all changes\nover time that are reported to WHD in the rates\nin the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) governing the\nclassification.\nUnion Average Rate Identifiers\n1/7/25, 11:01 AM SAM.gov\nhttps://sam.gov/wage-determination/GA20250305/0 4/6"

    "text": "The UAVG identifier indicates that no single rate prevailed for\nthose classifications, but that 100% of the data reported for\nthe classifications reflected union rates. EXAMPLE:\nUAVG-OH-0010 01/01/2024. UAVG indicates that the rate is a\nweighted union average rate. OH indicates the State of Ohio.\nThe next number, 0010 in the example, is an internal number\nused in producing the wage determination. The date, 01/01/2024\nin the example, indicates the date the wage determination was\nupdated to reflect the most current union average rate.\nA UAVG rate will be updated once a year, usually in January, to\nreflect a weighted average of the current rates in the\ncollective bargaining agreements on which the rate is based.\nSurvey Rate Identifiers\nThe \"\"SU\"\" identifier indicates that either a single non-union\nrate prevailed (as defined in 29 CFR 1.2) for this\nclassification in the survey or that the rate was derived by\ncomputing a weighted average rate based on all the rates\nreported in the survey for that classification. As a weighted\naverage rate includes all rates reported in the survey, it may\ninclude both union and non-union rates. Example: SUFL2022-007\n6/27/2024. SU indicates the rate is a single non-union\nprevailing rate or a weighted average of survey data for that\nclassification. FL indicates the State of Florida. 2022 is the\nyear of the survey on which these classifications and rates are\nbased. The next number, 007 in the example, is an internal\nnumber used in producing the wage determination. The date,\n6/27/2024 in the example, indicates the survey completion date\nfor the classifications and rates under that identifier.\n?SU? wage rates typically remain in effect until a new survey\nis conducted. However, the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) has the\ndiscretion to update such rates under 29 CFR 1.6(c)(1).\nState Adopted Rate Identifiers\nThe \"\"SA\"\" identifier indicates that the classifications and\nprevailing wage rates set by a state (or local) government were\nadopted under 29 C.F.R 1.3(g)-(h).  Example: SAME2023-007\n01/03/2024. SA reflects that the rates are state adopted. ME\nrefers to the State of Maine. 2023 is the year during which the\nstate completed the survey on which the listed classifications\nand rates are based. The next number, 007 in the example, is an\ninternal number used in producing the wage determination.\nThe date, 01/03/2024 in the example, reflects the date on which\nthe classifications and rates under the ?SA? identifier took\neffect under state law in the state from which the rates were\nadopted.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nWAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS\n1) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can\nbe:\n           a) a survey underlying a wage determination\n           b) an existing published wage determination\nc) an initial WHD letter setting forth a position on\na wage determination matter\nd) an initial conformance (additional classification\nand rate) determination\n1/7/25, 11:01 AM SAM.gov\nhttps://sam.gov/wage-determination/GA20250305/0 5/6"
